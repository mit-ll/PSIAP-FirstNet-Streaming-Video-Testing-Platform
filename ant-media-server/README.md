## FirstNet Ant Media Server documentation


### Open Broadcaster Software Studio 
OBS Studio is a software package used to stream video from the server to the clients.  Ant Media Server has the capability to record and playback streams but it cannot host video streams.  We use OBS to stream a looped pre-recorded video to the server and use the Android application to test client performance.
